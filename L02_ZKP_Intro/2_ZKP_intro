## ZKP intro


### Complexity Theory

Complexity theory is used to analyze resourse usage such as time and space so solve a computational problem. 

#### Complexity Classes
- P(Polynomial Time)
- NP(Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)
- NP-complete 
- NP-hard
- IP(Interactive Proofs)

Big O notation is used to describe the complexity (usually the upper bound complexity) in algebric terms for a solution to a computational problem.

| | Snarks | Starks  | Bulletproofs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Algorithmic Complexity: Prover | O(N*log(N))  | O(N* poly-log(N))  | O(N*log(N)) |
| Algorithmic Complexity: Verifier | ~O(1) | O(poly-log(N))  | O(N) |
| Communicational Complexity | ~O(1) | O(poly-log(N))  | O(log(N)) |
